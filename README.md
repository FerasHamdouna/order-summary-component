## Overview

### The challenge

Build out this order summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. The component should be responsive and include hover states for the change plan link and the proceed-to-payment button.

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
-   See hover states for interactive elements ("Change" link and "Proceed to Payment" button).
-   Access the plan details and pricing clearly.
